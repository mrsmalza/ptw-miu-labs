            </div> <b>Zenbook</b> (also known as ZenBook) are a family of ultrabooks – low-bulk laptop computers – produced by Asus. The first Zenbooks were released in October 2011, and the original range of products was amended and expanded during 2012. Models range from 12-inch laptops, featuring power efficient components but lacking connectivity and having only integrated graphics processors, to 15-inch laptops with discrete graphics processing units and optical disc drives. Most (though not all) Zenbooks use Intel Core ultra-low-voltage processors and Nvidia GPUs when integrated graphics are not used. Asus introduced new models with touch screens to take advantage of Windows 8 after its release in late 2012. Most models drew comparisons to the Macbook Air. The most recent release in the Zenbook line is the upmarket Zenbook Infinity UX301 series. The Zenbook mainly competes against computers such as Acer's Aspire, Dell's Inspiron and XPS, HP's Pavilion and Envy, Lenovo's IdeaPad and Toshiba's Satellite.
            
                Asus designed the Zenbooks with brushed aluminium chassis and high rigidity, rather than plastic, the usual laptop construction material. A pattern of concentric circles on the lids is said to represent ripples in water and represent the "zen philosophy" that designers wanted to portray when creating the laptops. Zenbooks have been generally well received due to their chassis design and appearance as well as the high quality screens used in later models. However, the touchpad software was found to be erratic, particularly on the early models and some of the models received criticism for their high prices. Some models (such as the UX32) suffer from lockdown when the lithium polymer battery cell gets drained or discharged below its recommended threshold, for example if the device is left on and unattended. The result is that the charger will fail to recharge the battery even when plugged in, leaving the machine in a near-complete unresponsive off-state. The machine can often be revived by pressing the power-on key for 10 seconds, whereupon it will start recharging.

        The first generation of Zenbooks was announced on October 11, 2011, one day before release, although they were first demonstrated at Computex 2011 in May that year. Two models were released in 2011 to positive reviews: the 11 inch UX21E and the 13 inch UX31E, also frequently known as the UX21 and UX31 respectively. The design of the UX21 drew comparisons to the Macbook Air and it was regarded as an "excellent rival" by CNET reviewer Andrew Hoyle. Other aspects of the laptops that reviewers liked were the Bang and Olufsen speakers, fast boot times due to Asus' BIOS design and the speed of general tasks within the operating system resulting from the SSD and Sandy Bridge processors. However, the screens drew criticism for their poor contrast ratio, colour accuracy and less than perfect viewing angle, although they were praised for their brightness and the sharpness of the UX31's screen. Reviewers also noted the shallow key-press of the metal keyboard and lack of backlighting, a feature that Asus did not have time to implement before shipping.

        In April 2012 Asus revealed a revision of the two original Zenbooks, this time based on the Ivy Bridge microarchitecture. The model numbers were UX21A and UX31A for the 11 and 13 inch models respectively but are more frequently referred to as Zenbook Primes. Changes made to the original included the aforementioned update to Ivy Bridge processors and the introduction of the corresponding HM76 chipset bringing native USB 3.0, 1920 × 1080 IPS displays for both models, an Intel Centrino Wi-Fi controller, an improved trackpad and new plastic keyboard with backlighting. The new screens were highly praised by reviewers when considering brightness, contrast ratio, viewing angle and colour accuracy, the improvements over previous models being put down to the switch from TN to IPS displays. The UX21A has contrast ratio of 939 and the UX31A achieved 1085, giving it the highest resolution and contrast ratio of any ultrabook at the time of release. The improved keyboard also garnered praise for the increased backlighting and improved key travel while the Intel Wi-Fi controller was found to perform better than the Qualcomm used in the first generation of Zenbooks. The Zenbook Primes still received some criticism: the latest version of the trackpad was acknowledged as an improvement over the original Zenbooks, but still irritating, and the sound quality was found to be worse than that with the first generation. Despite these issues, the overall reaction was positive: the UX31A was called "today's best ultrabook" and "the best ultrabook out there" at the time of release.

        On October 23, 2012, Asus hosted a launch event for Windows 8, where it revealed UX42VS and UX52VS models to be released in November. The UX42VS is a 14 inch ultrabook and the UX52VS is a 15 inch laptop, which may qualify as an ultrabook depending on the options chosen. The UX42VS is available with an Intel Core i3, i5 or i7 processor with up to 6 GB of RAM. In total, it weighs approximately 1.9 kg (4.2 lb).
        The UX52VS has the option of Intel's ultra-low voltage i5 or i7 mobile processors, up to 10 GB of RAM and an optical disc drive. The latter is a first for the Zenbook product series. It drew criticism for its high price and lack of touch screen, but the screen quality, keyboard and system speed were praised. The battery life was considered acceptable taking into account the form-factor and the discrete GPU, despite it being significantly shorter than the UX31A.
